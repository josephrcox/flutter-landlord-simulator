# *Real - how to guide*

## Objective
Your objective is to buy residental properties, keep them full of happy residents, and adapt to the economic swings of the market. 

### Lose conditions
ðŸš§ If you are in debt (have less than $0) for more than 30 days, you lose. 

## How to play
### Starting out
When you start the game, you will be given some money that you can use to buy your first property and search for your first residents. 

Searching for residents costs money (headhunting, fees, ads, interviews) and you will have to pay for it. This costs between 10% and 20% of the property's rent. This does not guarantee that you will find a resident though, this may require multiple 'taps'.

The higher the **ðŸ˜Š Happiness** level of your property, the easier it is to find residents, and the more likely that they will stick around. 

### Make more out of your properties
As you get more money, you can change your property and it's offerings.

The first type of change that you can make is adding **Amenities**. These are things like pools, pet privileges, gyms, etc. These may cost money to implement, but may increase the happiness of your residents, and some may even make you money. 

ðŸš§ The second type of change that you can make are **Upgrades**. Upgrades transform your property into something new. These are costly but can be great investments.

### The Economy
The economy is always changing. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. You can see the current state of the economy in the header labeled with **Economy health**. 

Economy health ranges from 0 to 300. The higher the number, the better the economy. 

ðŸš§ When the economy is good, you can charge more for rent, and your residents will be happier. When the economy is bad, you will have to charge less for rent, and your residents will be less happy. 

This is something you always have to be ready for. 

## ðŸš§ Upgrades
Every property starts out at a Level 1. As you upgrade, you can have more residents and add exclusive **Amenities**. 

| Levels | Max residents | Cost to upgrade |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1      | 10            | 0               |
| 2      | 30            | $175,000        |
| 3      | 60            | $200,000        |
| 4      | 90            | $250,000        |
